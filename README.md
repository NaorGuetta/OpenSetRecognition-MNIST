# OpenSetRecognition-MNIST
An Open Set Recognition (OSR) experiment on the MNIST dataset to identify known and unknown digit classes using deep learning.

# Open Set Recognition on MNIST 🧠🔢

This project demonstrates **Open Set Recognition (OSR)** on the classic **MNIST** dataset. While traditional classification assumes all classes are known during training, Open Set Recognition handles the more realistic scenario where unknown (unseen) classes may appear at test time.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- ✅ **Dataset:** MNIST handwritten digits
- ✅ **Goal:** Train a classifier to distinguish known digits while identifying novel/unseen digits as "unknown"
- ✅ **Approach:**  
  This project leverages a **Multi-Task AutoEncoder (MultiTaskAE)**, designed to:
  1. **Reconstruct** MNIST digit images, ensuring the model captures the underlying structure of known classes.
  2. **Learn meaningful latent representations** by clustering embeddings of known classes in latent space.

  For **Open Set Recognition**, two main strategies are applied:
  - **Reconstruction Error**: Higher errors indicate unfamiliar (unknown) samples.
  - **Latent Space Distance**: The model measures the distance between a sample’s latent embedding and the centroid of each known class cluster. If the distance exceeds a threshold, the sample is flagged as "unknown."

This dual strategy enhances the model's ability to distinguish between known and unknown classes effectively.
